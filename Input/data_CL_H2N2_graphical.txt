# This value is subtracted from the real impedance to correct for
# the ohmic resistance of cell components that appears in the HFR.
# If the input spectrum represents a catalyst layer, supply 0.
# If the input spectrum represents a full cell, supply total ohmic
# resistance of all cell components except catalyst layers.
HFR correction, mOhm*cm2 = 0.0

# Catalyst-layer thickness, um
Catalyst-layer thickness, um = 4.5

# Volumetric double-layer capacitance, F/cm3
Volumetric double-layer capacitance, F/cm3 = 54.0

# Cutoff value of real impedance, mOhm*cm2.
# Fitting of the high-frequency linear branch will be performed
# between the HFR and this value.
Real impedance cutoff, mOhm*cm2 = 60

# Threshold within which the HFR-corrected real and imaginary
# parts of impedance must be equal in order for a particular
# part of a spectrum to be recognized as linear.
# Example: enter 0.02 for 2%
Linear branch threshold = 0.02

# Number of low-frequency data points for a linear fit of
# the 90-degree branch.
Number of low-frequency points to fit = 5

# If True, frequencies will be shown on a log scale in the Bode plot
Use log scale in Bode plot = True
