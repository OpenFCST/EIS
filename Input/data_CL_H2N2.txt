# This value is subtracted from the real impedance to correct for
# the ohmic resistance of cell components that appears in the HFR.
# If the input spectrum represents a catalyst layer, supply 0.
# If the input spectrum represents a full cell, supply total ohmic
# resistance of all cell components except catalyst layers.
HFR correction, mOhm*cm2 = 0.0

# Volumetric double-layer capacitance, F/cm3
Volumetric double-layer capacitance, F/cm3 = 54.0

# Catalyst-layer thickness, um
Catalyst-layer thickness, um = 4.5

# Cutoff value of real impedance, mOhm*cm2.
# Fitting of the high-frequency linear branch will be performed
# between the HFR and this value.
Real impedance cutoff, mOhm*cm2 = 60

# Threshold within which the HFR-corrected real and imaginary
# parts of impedance must be equal in order for a particular
# part of a spectrum to be recognized as linear.
# Example: enter 0.02 for 2%
Linear branch threshold = 0.02

# Search grid for electronic conductivity, S/cm.
Minimum electronic conductivity, S/cm = 0.001
Maximum electronic conductivity, S/cm = 0.07
Electronic-conductivity step size, S/cm = 0.001

# Same as above, but for protonic conductivity, S/cm.
Minimum protonic conductivity, S/cm = 0.0001
Maximum protonic conductivity, S/cm = 0.004
Protonic-conductivity step size, S/cm = 0.0001

# Method for computing residual
# Options are:
# abs     - absolute difference (magnitude of Z_input-Z_model),
# rel     - relative difference (absolute difference normalized by Z_model)
# rel_mag - absolute difference normalized by the magnitude of Z_model
Residual method = rel_mag

# If True, frequencies will be shown on a log scale in the Bode plot
Use log scale in Bode plot = False

# If True, impedance will be computed with the fitted conductivities at all
# input frequencies instead of only those corresponding to the linear branch.
# The resulting fitted impedance is saved to the output file.
# Only used in the non-graphical H2_O2 and H2_N2 methods.
Output whole fitted spectrum = False
